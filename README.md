# 👋 Hi, I'm Jai

I'm a Machine Learning graduate student at Georgia Tech focused on building **efficient LLMs** and practical **AI agent systems**. I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of **scalability**, **reasoning**, and **accessibility in AI**.

---

### 🔬 Current Focus
- ⚡ Efficient LLMs: Faster Inference using LoRA fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, quantization, KV cache compression  
- 🤖 Autonomous AI Agents: Natural language-driven task automation using LLMs  
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation: RAG systems for scalable and interpretable QA  

---

### 🛠️ Projects
- **LLM-powered Browser Agent**  
  An autonomous agent that takes a natural language prompt and performs browser-based tasks using Playwright + LLM planning.

- **GT Academic Chatbot**  
  A chatbot for Georgia Tech students and advisors that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer scheduling and academic queries.

- **Efficient Fine-tuning of LLMs**  
  Experiments with LoRA, distillation, quantization, and KV cache compression to deploy smaller, faster, and accurate LLMs.

- **Clinical Note Summarization** *(Research)*  
  Summarizing long-form AIS patient records with factual consistency using both extractive and abstractive techniques.

### 📚 Selected Skills & Tools
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain  
**Infra & Tools:** Weights & Biases, Playwright, AWS  
**Concepts:** LoRA, RAG, Agents, Prompt Engineering, LLM Optimization
